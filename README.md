## Application Layer

The Application Layer determines whether adequate resources exist for communication. It manages communications between apps and then directs data to the correct program

This layer is also responsible for converting data into a format that is usable by apps and directing data to the proper app window. If multiple instances exist, the layer will ensure that data is delivered to the corect app instance

Protocols used by the Application Layer include:

Protocol | Description
------------ | -------------
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) | Transfer web pages over the internet
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) | Transfer files over a network
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) | Transfer files over a network
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) | Assign IP addressing information to clients
Domain Name System (DNS) | Translate host names to IPs
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) | Send email messages
Post Office Protocol (POP3) | Receive email messages
Telnet | Create terminal connection to remote devices
Secure Shell (SSH) | Create a secure remote terminal connection to networked device

## Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer is responsible for converting and representing the payload in different formats - eg. data-based, character-based, image-based, audio-based, video-based and more

Compression and encryption are often handled by this layer

Some formats used by the Presentation Layer include:

* Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)
* Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
* Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG)
* QuickTime

## Session Layer

The Session Layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining and terminating data communications between apps or devices

Sessions are made up of requests and responses. The Session Layer identifies the data as belonging to a particular session and ensures that the requests and responses are sent back and forth between the two parties

Protocols that operate at the Session Layer include:

Protocol | Description
------------ | -------------
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) | Authentication protocol that uses a simple user and password pair
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) | Allows clients to initiate a process that is executed on a remote server

## Transport Layer

The Transport Layer is responsible for error-free delivery of information between devices. It is also repsonsible for flow control and sequencing. The information traversing the Transport Layer is called a __segment__

Protocols that operate at the Transport Layer include:

Protocol | Description
------------ | -------------
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) | Provides connectionless, unreliable data transfer between networked computers
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) | Provides connection-oriented, reliable data transfer between networked computers

## Network Layer

The Network Layer is responsible for logical addressing and routing on a network. Logical addressing methods include those defined by IPv4 and IPv6. The information traversing the Network layer is called a __packet__

Examples of protocols that are used at this layer include:

Protocol | Description
------------ | -------------
IPv4 | Used to uniquely identify devices on a network
IPv6 | Used to uniquely identify devices on a network
Open Shortest Path First | Link State-Routing Protocol
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) | Cisco created hybrid routing protocol

## Data Link Layer

The Data Link layer defines how devices communicate over a network. It is responsible for managing physical addressing and switching on a network. Physical (MAC) addresses are handled here. Information traversing the Data Link layer is called a __frame__

Data Link layer devices include switches and bridges

Switching is handled at the Data Link layer because switches use physical addresses to forward packets to the correct port

Some portions of the 802.11 wireless standard function at the Data Link layer and some portions at the Physical Layer

Protocols that operate at the Data Link layer include:

* Ethernet
* Frame Relay
* Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
* Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)

## Physical Layer

The Physical Layer defines how bits are passed over a medium. They can be passed electronically, mechanically, optically or by radio signals

Media can include:

* Coaxial cable
* Twisted-pair copper cable
* Fiber-optic cable

Physical layer includes the connectors used to connect the cables to the devices that operate at this layer. This layer passes bits between the Data Link layer and physical devices on a network

Examples of devices that operate at this layer are:

* Network Interface Cards (NIC)
* Hubs
* Repeaters

The devices that operate at the Physical Layer receive and forward bits to other devices without making any path determination about the bits. The devices simply forward the bits to the next hop in the network

Protocols that operate at the Physical Layer include:

* Ethernet
* Universal Serial Bus (USB)
* Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)

## Network Devices <a name="NET"></a> ([Back to Index](#INDEX))

## Hubs

Hubs are multiport physical repeaters that are used to connect end-user workstations. An incoming frame is rebroadcast out __all other ports__ except the port it came in on. They are inexpensive devices that do not create separate broadcast and collision domains

Hubs do not make any forwarding decisions based on MAC address or IP address

A collision domain is a network segment where collisions can occur when frames are sent among the devices on that network segment

If 4 computers are connected to a hub, all 4 share the same bandwidth. Each device can only use a portion of the total bandwidth. Collisions can occur when frames are sent simultaneously by multiple computers attached to the hub

Ethernet devices rely on __Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)__ to mitigate collisions

With CSMA/CD a transmitting device listens on the network segment before it attempts to send data. If no transmissions are there, it sends data and listens to determine whether a collision occured. If a collision is detected, each transmitting device waits a random period of time before attempting to retransmit

Collision detection can function only when the devices do not attempt to transmit and receive at the same time.

Hubs are restricted to half-duplex mode meaning they cannot transmit and receive at the same time

## Bridges

Bridges use the MAC address of data recipients to deliver frames. Bridges maintain a forwarding database in which the MAC addresses of the attached hosts are stored.

When a packet is received by a bridge, the sender's MAC address is recorded in the forwarding database. If the address is also stored in the forwarding database, the packet will be sent directly to the recipient. If the address is not in the database, the packet is broadcast out all ports excluding the port it arrived on

Each host receives the packet and uses the MAC address to determine if it is for them

When the intended recipient responds to the packet, the bridge sends the reply directly to the original sender.

Bridges can be used to increase the number of collision domains - each port on a bridge creates a separate collision domain. They do not create separate broadcast domains - all devices connected to a bridge will reside in the same broadcast domain

## Switches

Switches can be used to provide network connectivity to endpoint devices. They can operate at Layer 2 or Layer 3. Layer 2 switches function similiarly to bridges. Layer 3 switches add routing functionality

Switches use information in the __data packet__ headers to forward packets to the correct ports. This results in fewer collisions, improved traffic flow and faster performance

Switches break a large network into smaller networks. Switches perform __microsegmentation__ of collision domains - this creates a separate dedicated network segment for each port

Layer 2 switches use physical addresses known as MAC addresses. They are used to carry out their primary responsibility of switching frames. Switches store known MAC addresses in a special area of memory known as the __Content Addressable Memory (CAM)__ table. The CAM table associates MAC addresses with the physical interface through which those addresses can be reached

When a switch receives a frame, it adds the source MAC to the CAM table. The switch then checks the CAM table to see if the destination MAC address is listed. If it is, it directs the frame to the appropriate port. If not, it broadcasts the frame out all ports except the port it arrived on

If 4 computers are connected to a switch, each computer will reside in its own collision domain. All 4 computers can send data to the switch simultaneously

Because switches forward broadcasts, all devices connected to a Layer 2 switch will reside within a single broadcast domain. Layer 3 switches can use VLANs to separate the broadcast domains

## Routers

Routers are used to forward packets between computer networks. Routers create separate broadcast domains. Devices connected to a router reside in a separate broadcast domain. A broadcast that is sent on one network segment attached to the router will not be forwarded to any other network

Layer 3 switches share many features and capabilities with routers

Routers make path decisions based on logical addresses such as IP addresses. Routers store IP address information in a routing table. The routing table is stored in a special section of memory known as the __Ternary CAM (TCAM) table__. The TCAM table is used to provide wire speed access to data for queries. The TCAM table can provide a non-exact match for a particular query

Routers can implement multiple TCAM tables - commonly used to facilitate the implementation of access control list (ACL) rules, Quality of Service (QoS) rules, etc...

When a router receives a packet, it forwards the packet to the destination network based on information in a routing table. 

If a router receives a packet that is destined for a remote network that is not listed in the table and neither a static default router nor a gateway of last resort has been configured, the packet is dropped and an ICMP Unreachable Error is sent to the interface it was received on

## Servers

Many different types of network servers and various functions associated with them. Servers can either be a specific piece of hardware or a software program - typically set up to provide specific services to a group of other computers on a network

Servers provide a centralized way to control, manage and distribute a variety of technologies - simple data files, applications, security policies, network addresses

Some examples of services include:

Server | Description
------------ | -------------
File Servers | Can configure a file server to allow users to access shared files/folders, used as a central storage location
Domain Servers | Manages resources that are available on the domain, used to configure access and security policies for users
Print Servers | Provides access to a limited number of printers to many computer users rather than a local printer for each PC
DHCP Servers | Automatically provide IP addresses to client computers, clients can connect to the server and automatically get an IP
Web Servers | Allows customers to access your company website, typically contain content that is viewable in a browser
Proxy Servers | Intermediary between browser and internet. When computers connect to the internet, the computer first connects to the proxy server. The proxy performs one of the following actions - forwards traffic, blocks traffic, returns cached webpage
